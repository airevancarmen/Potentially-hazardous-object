# Potentially-hazardous-object

Workshop 1: 
Are we safe?
1) Chose ONE dimension of this data-set of near-earth objects to estimate how safe we really are. To do this you will:

TASKS 
1) Question the data.
2) Determine which single dimension of data is most relevant to this question.
3) Establish safety thresholds:
ie. Is 1000 objects within 1000 miles a meaningful danger threshold?
4) Clean the dataset down to only that dimension.
5) Do basic pre-analysis data visualization.
6) Run the cleaned data set through your std module.
Try to make an inference about the total population of near-earth objects based on your measurements.
Present your findings to each other, including your recommended actions based on your conclusions.

DEFINITION (Wikipedia)
Potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) are defined as having a minimum orbital intersection distance with Earth of less than 0.05 astronomical units (19.5 lunar distances) and an absolute magnitude of 22 or brighter. As of January 2018 there are 1,885 known PHAs (about 11% of the total near-Earth population), of which 157 are estimated to be larger than one kilometer in diameter (see list of largest PHAs below).Most of the discovered PHAs are Apollo asteroids (1,601) and fewer belong to the group of Aten asteroids (169).
